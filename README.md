Notes on Arduino 

There is the setup function 
There is the loop function 

the #define directive 
int is a variable type 

Bringing Parameters into the function

When dividing your sketch up into functions it is often useful to think about what service a function could provide. 

Where we define the function at the bottom of the sketch, we have to declare the type of variable in the parameters.
